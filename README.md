# updated-portfolio-page-2

This is a webpage for Dexter Griffith's professional portfolio.

## Description

Build a professional portfolio from scratch using the skills we have learned from the previous weeks. I will build a website using html semantics and create a index.html file to contain them on. I will then use CSS properties to make the site more functional in an attempt to increase the websites SEO and visual appeal. 

## Tasks Completed 

1. Created a basic HTML template with a header, main, body and footer sections. 
2. Expanded HTML template to fit needs for this project. 

        **Example: Added rows and columns to fill need for future project slots on webpage.
3. Created CSS style sheet needed for visual aid. 
4. Formatted CSS style sheet to fit project needs.

        **Example: adjusting borders and adding padding to objects to get visual representation where it was needed. Adding hover affects to elements to give webpage some design pop, and increase SEO. 
5. Changed title of website and edited footer section and fixed all non-functioning link locations. 
6. Added Nav bar to the top of the website to give quick link selectors for website. 
7. Adjusted parameters to increase SEO for smaller devices. 
8. Updated Portfolio to include updated projects.
9. Changed background and cleaned up the page a little bit by changing colors and cards used in portfolio.
10. Made sure elements had good flow an logical positioning on HTML side and on the webpage.   
11. Changed contact me section to clickable icons and not just href tags 
12. Added newer-better projects onto portfolio. 
13. Added project 2 onto portfolio page
14. Adjusted pictures on portfolio to eliminate the placeholder picture that was previously there for a picture of each project. 

## Installation
